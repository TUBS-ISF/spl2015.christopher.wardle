Tested the project with Eclipse with the following configurations:

Configuration 1: Repeat and Shuffle on
Configuration 2: Repeat on, Shuffle off
Configuration 3: Repeat off, Shuffle on
Configuration 4: both off

Program's behaviour was as expected, only selected buttons were displayed.
If no parameters are specified, configuration 4 will be applied.
